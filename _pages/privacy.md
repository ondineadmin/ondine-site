This is the privacy notice of Ondine Limited, a company registered in Ireland under number 702411. In this document, “we”, “our”, or “us” refers to Ondine Limited.  
This is a notice to inform you of our policy in respect of all information that we record about you. This policy applies to information that could identify you as well as to information that could not.  
We are extremely concerned to protect your privacy and confidentiality. We understand that all users of our web site are quite rightly concerned to know that their data will not be used for any purpose unintended by them and will not accidentally fall into the hands of a third party. Our policy is both specific and strict. It complies with Irish law and with EU law. If you think our policy falls short of your expectations or that we are failing to abide by our policy, do please tell us.  
We regret that if there are one or more points below with which you are not happy, your only recourse is to leave our web site immediately.  
Except as set out below, we do not share, or sell, or disclose to a third party, any personally identifiable information collected at this site.  
Here is a list of the information we collect from you, either through our website or because you give it to us in some other way, and why it is necessary to collect it:  

**1. Business and Personal Information**  
This includes basic identification and contact information, such as your name and contact details, and also includes all information given to us in the course of your business with ours, such as information you give us in your capacity as our client. We undertake to preserve the confidentiality of the information and of the terms of our relationship. The information you give us in this capacity is not used for any other purpose. We expect you to reciprocate this policy.
Your business and personal information is used:

1. to provide you with the services which you request;  
2. to verify your identity for security purposes;  
3. for marketing our services and products to you;  
4. Information which does not identify any individual may be used in a general way by us or third parties, to provide class/group information, for example relating to geographical location or usage of a particular page or service.  

We keep information which forms part of our business record for a minimum of six years. That is because we may need it in some way to support a claim or defence in court proceedings. That is also the period within which our tax collecting authorities may demand to know it.  

**2. Your Domain Name and E-mail Address**  
This information is recognised by our servers and the pages that you visit are recorded. We shall not, under any circumstances, divulge your e-mail address to any person who is not an employee or contractor of ours and who does not need to know it, either generally or specifically. This information is used:

1. to correspond with you or deal with you as you expect;
2. in a collective way, not referable to any particular individual or business, for the purpose of quality control and improvement of our site;
3. to send you news about the services to which you have signed up;
4. to tell you about other of our services.

**3. Website Usage Information**  
We may use software embedded in our website (such as JavaScript) to collect information about the pages you view and how you have reached them, what you do when you visit a page, the length of time you remain on the page, and how we perform in providing content to you. We do not presently associate such information with an identifiable person.

**4. Financial Information relating to your Credit Cards**  
This information is never taken by us either through our website or otherwise. At the point of payment, you are transferred to a secure page on the website of PayPal or some other reputable payment service provider. That page may be dressed in our “livery”, but it is not controlled by us. Our staff and contractors never have access to it.

**5. Information we obtain from Third Parties**  
Although we do not disclose your personal information to any third party (except as set out in this Notice), we do receive data which is indirectly made up from your personal information, from software services such as Google Analytics and others. No such information is identifiable to you.

**6. Content you provide to us with a view to being used by a Third Party/Third Parties**  
If you provide information to us with a view to it being read, copied, downloaded, forwarded, or used by other people, we accept no responsibility for what that third party or third parties may do with it. It is up to you to satisfy yourself about the privacy level of every person who might see your information.

**7. Cookies**  
Cookies are small text files that are placed on your computer’s hard drive through your web browser when you visit any website. They are widely used to make websites work, or work more efficiently, as well as to provide information to the owners of the site.
We reserve the right to use cookies. Like all other users of cookies, we may request the return of information from your computer when your browser requests a web page from our server. Cookies enable our web server to identify you to us, and to track your actions and the pages you visit while you use our website. The cookies we use may last for a single visit to our site (they are deleted from your computer when you close your browser), or may remain on your computer until you delete them or until a defined period of time has passed.
Although your browser software enables you to disable cookies, we recommend that you allow the use of cookies in order to take advantage of the features of our website that rely on their use. If you prevent their use, you will not be able to use all the functionality of our website. Here are the ways we use cookies:

1. to record whether you have accepted the use of cookies on our website. This is solely to comply with the law. If you have chosen not to accept cookies, we will not use cookies for your visit, but unfortunately, our site will not work well for you.
2. to allow essential parts of our web site to operate for you.
3. to operate our content management system.
4. to operate an online contact form – a form that you may use to contact us for any reason. This cookie is set on your arrival at our web site and deleted when you close your browser.
5. to enhance security on our contact form. It is set for use only through the contact form. This cookie is deleted when you close your browser.
6. to collect information about how visitors use our site. We use the information to improve your experience of our site. This cookie collects information in an anonymous form, including the number of visitors to the site, where visitors have come to the site from, and the pages they visited.
7. to record that a user has viewed a webcast. It collects information in an anonymous form. This cookie expires when you close your browser.
8. to enable you to watch videos we have placed on YouTube. YouTube will not store personally identifiable cookie information when you use YouTube’s privacy-enhanced mode.

**8. Job Applications and Employment**  
If you send us information in connection with a job application, we may keep it for up to three years in case we decide to contact you at a later date. If we employ you, we collect information about you and your work from time to time throughout the period of your employment. This information will be used only for purposes directly relevant to your employment. After your employment has ended, we will keep your file for six years before destroying or deleting it.

**9. Marketing Information**  
With your prior written permission only, we may pass your email address and name to selected associates whom we consider may provide services or products you would find useful. You may opt out of this service at any time by instructing us at [info@ondine-survey.com](mailto:info@ondine-survey.com)

**10. Disclosure to Government and their Agencies**  
We are subject to the law in the same way as other individuals and other legal entities. We may be required to give information to legal authorities if they so request or if they have the proper authorisation such as a search warrant or court order.

**11. Compliance with the Law**  
This confidentiality policy has been compiled so as to comply with Irish and EU law. If you think it fails to satisfy the law of your country, we should like to hear from you, but ultimately it is your choice as to whether you wish to use our website.

**12. Review or Update Personally Identifiable Information**  
At any time you may review or update the personally identifiable information that we hold about you, by contacting us at the address below. To better safeguard your information, we will also take reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting access or making corrections to your information.

**13. Removing Your Information**  
If you wish us to remove personally identifiable information from our website, you may contact us at [info@ondine-survey.com](mailto:info@ondine-survey.com). To better safeguard your information, we will also take reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting access or making corrections to your information.

**14. Data may be “processed” outside the Republic of Ireland**  
Our websites are hosted in Ireland. We may also use outsourced services in countries outside the EU from time to time in other aspects of our business. Accordingly, data obtained within the Republic of Ireland may be “processed” outside the Republic of Ireland and data obtained in any other country may be processed within or outside that country.

If you have any question regarding this Privacy Policy, please contact us through the contact page.
