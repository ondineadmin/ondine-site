        <p class="team-desc">I thoroughly enjoy my job due to its diverse nature. The daily variations keep things
            engaging as I never quite know what to expect next. Working with vessels and overseeing their management is
            particularly appealing to me. It's a field that aligns with my interests, and being involved in these
            operations brings me considerable satisfaction. Additionally, being part of Ondine is a fantastic
            experience, as it's a great company with exceptional individuals who contribute to its success. Overall, the
            combination of diversity and unpredictability makes my job highly enjoyable within this excellent company,
            all while working towards a greener more environmentally sustainable marine survey industry.</p>

        <h4 class="team-title">QHSE Manager</h4>
        <p class="team-desc">It's a natural human instinct to resist change, I mean why would you want to change if
            things are going ok? The reality is that the longer a process goes without change then the feeling of being
            satisfied is just an illusion, we should not accept things just being ok, we need to continually improve on
            what we do and how we do it.</p>

            continuous learning and development. We invest in training programs that equip our workforce with the skills needed
